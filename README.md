# Autocorrect
This code has been executed using Jupyter notebook.
Each code area between the spaces has to be written in seperate columns.
These columns are represented using:- In[ ].
We have to install nltk using command "pip install nltk".
Then we import nltk and its requiered functions.
We then download word file from nltk.download command.
We then run the code.
A output box appears asking for input text.
